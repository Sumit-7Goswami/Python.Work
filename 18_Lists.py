print(a)

# if we have to take the first value of 'a' let suppose we want

'''list m be index zero se start hoti hai'''

'''another example'''
a = [1,2,4,56,6]

'''now if we run this code we get error , because there no element'''
###**** NOW we can also change the list
# Create a list using []
a = [1,2,4,56,6]
# print the list using print() functions
a[0] = 48   #change the value of list using [point 21] 
print(a)  




# We can create a list with items of different types
c = [66,"Sumit","Lion" , 12.3 , True]
print(c)



# List Slicing
friends = ["Rohan","Harry","Tom" , "Sam" ,"Divya" , 48]
print(friends[0:4])

#example
friends = ["Rohan","Harry","Tom" , "Sam" ,"Divya" , 48]
print(friends[-4:])
