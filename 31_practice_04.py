# what will we be the length of the following set S :
#       S = set()
#     S.add (20)
#     S.add(20.0)
#     S.add("20")
#                    '''lenght of S after the operation '''


s = {20,20.0,"20"}
print(len(s))

# we get 2 ,because in python ,set mee 20 or 20.0 ekk barr count hoga bss

#### QUESTION--->   S = {} , what is the type of S ???

#              answer '''Here S is a type of dictionary not set ,on seeing 
     #                     it is lool like null set ,but it dictionary set , null set is 
      #                   written like this S = Set()''''''

     write s = {}   and  type() ,then enter this and u get class'dict' '''
