### 1. if-elif-else ladder in python


a = 45 

if(a>3):
    print("The value of a is greater than 3")
elif(a<3):
    print("The value of a is greater than 7")
else:
    print("The value is not greater than 3 or 7")    



## 
a = 45 

if(a>3):
    print("The value of a is greater than 3")
elif(a>13):
    print("The value of a is greater than 13")
elif(a>7):
    print("The value of a is greater than 7")
elif(a>17):
    print("The value is not greater than 17")
else:
    print("The value is not greater than 3 or 7")


## 

a = 8 
if(a<3):
    print("The value of a greater than 3 ")
elif(a>13):
    print("The value of a is greater than 13")
elif(a>7):
    print("The value of a is greater than 7")
elif(a>17):
    print("The value of a is greater than 17")
else:
    print("The value of a is greater than 3 or 7")
     
print("Done")     



### 2. Multiple-If statement

a = 8 
if(a<3):
    print("The value of a greater than 3 ")
if(a>13):
    print("The value of a is greater than 13")
if(a>7):
    print("The value of a is greater than 7")
if(a>17):
    print("The value of a is greater than 17")
else:
    print("The value of a is greater than 3 or 7")
     
print("Done")
